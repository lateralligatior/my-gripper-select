MPG-plus
Gripper for small components

Powerful. Fast. Long fingers. 

Gripper for small components MPG-plus
2-finger parallel gripper with smooth roller guides of the base jaws

Field of application
Gripping and moving of small to medium-sized workpieces 
in low contaminated environments, such as assembly, 
testing, laboratory and pharmaceutical industry

MPG-plus
Gripper for small components

MPG-plus

Functional description
The oval piston is moved up or down by compressed air.
The angled active surfaces of the wedge-hook produce a 
synchronized, parallel jaw motion.

 
1 Base Jaw

for the connection of workpiece-specific gripper fingers

2 Wedge-hook design
for high force transmission and centric gripping

3 Cross roller guidance
precise gripping due to backlash-free base jaw guidance

4 Sensor system
for monitoring two switching points

5 Oval piston drive
for power generation

6 Housing
is weight-optimized due to the use of high-strength 
aluminum alloy

Gripper for small components

General notes about the series
Operating principle: Wedge-hook kinematics

Housing material: Aluminum alloy, anodized

Cover housing material: Steel

Base jaw material: Steel

Actuation: pneumatic, with filtered compressed air as per 
ISO 8573-1:2010 [7:4:4].

Warranty: 24 months

Scope of delivery: Centering sleeves, O-rings for direct 
connection, assembly instructions (operating manual with 
declaration of incorporation is available online)

Gripping force maintenance: possible by using the version 
with mechanical gripping force maintenance or pressure 
maintenance valve SDV-P

Gripping force: is the arithmetic sum of the individual 
force applied to each jaw at distance P (see illustration).

Finger length: is measured from the reference surface as 
the distance P in direction to the main axis. 
The maximum permissible finger length applies until the 
nominal operating pressure is achieved. With higher 
pressures, the finger length must be reduced proportio-
nally to the nominal operating pressure.

Repeat accuracy: is defined as a distribution of the end 
Position for 100 consecutive strokes.

Workpiece weight: is calculated for force-fit gripping with 
a coefficient of static friction of 0.1 and a safety factor of 2 
against workpiece slippage at acceleration due to gravity 
g. For form-fit or capture gripping, there are significantly 
higher permissible workpiece weights.

Closing and opening times: are purely the times that the 
base jaws or fingers are in motion. Valve switching times, 
hose fill times, or PLC reaction times are not included, and 
are to be considered when cycle times are calculated.

Options and special information
Gripping force maintenance version AS/IS: The mechanical gripping force maintenance version ensures minimum gripping 
force even in the event of a pressure drop. In the AS/S version this acts as a closing force, in the IS version as an opening 
force.
Optional adapter plates: allows frontal mounting of the gripper
Precision version P: for the highest accuracy
Version FPS for flexible position sensor: This version is prepared for the use with the flexible position sensor FPS, and 
allows monitoring of several gripping positions.
